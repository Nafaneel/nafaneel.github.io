          <p>NexusSnarl was a sophisticated project that began as an experimental endeavor with radios and evolved into
            a system for remotely controlling and transmitting audio over radio frequencies. It started in January 2021
            when I purchased three radios to experiment with DTMF (Dual-tone multi-frequency) features for
            electrical projects. The project took a turn when a classmate faked a positive COVID test, giving me an
            excuse to try and intercept the school's radio communications from home. Initially, the focus was
            on
            listening to the school's radio transmissions using a radio. However, the project quickly escalated
            into an attempt to transmit on the same frequency.</p>

          <p>The first successful transmission was a simple beep tone, which confirmed the feasibility of transmitting
            on the
            school's frequency. This success led to further experiments, including coordinating tests with friends to
            record and analyze the transmissions.</p>
          <p>As the project progressed, I developed a series of software iterations to enhance functionality
            and control. The first software prototype utilized the Discord.py API to control the radios through a Python
            application. This setup used the VOX feature of a two-way radio, where a short squelch break burst would be
            played, followed by the desired sound. This basic system was gradually refined into more sophisticated
            versions. The software was rebranded from PMR Jammer to NexusSnarl to avoid drawing attention to its
            purpose. Subsequent versions introduced features such as a token system to limit usage, improved graphical
            user interfaces (GUIs), and logging mechanisms to track commands and transmissions.</p>
          <p>
            NexusSnarl started as a fun experiment with radios and quickly became popular among my peers for its ability
            to transmit amusing and cryptic messages on the school's frequency. Friends enjoyed the secretive broadcasts
            and the inside jokes they created, enhancing the project's appeal. However, while it entertained the
            students, it increasingly annoyed the school staff, who were baffled by the disruptions. The project evolved
            with more sophisticated features, but its growing frequency of use drew heightened scrutiny. Eventually,
            despite my efforts to remain undetected, after 2 years the persistent disruptions led to my
            capture, bringing an end to the entertaining but disruptive project.</p>

          <p>
            In year 10, driven by boredom during maths, I found myself frequently looking around the room,
            contemplating what I could create to inject some excitement into the routine. My eyes often landed on the
            classroom projector, and an idea began to form. I thought it would be interesting to build a remote control
            for the projector, enabling me to manipulate it from a distance. This sparked the beginning of my new
            project, which I named [PROJ] (<b>PRO</b>totype <b>PROJ</b>ector remote <b>PROJ</b>ect).</p>
          <p>
            To make [PROJ] a reality, I first needed to understand how the projectorâ€™s remote control worked. I borrowed
            a remote from a classroom and set out to decode its signals. This involved a meticulous process of capturing
            and writing down the hex codes that the remote used to communicate with the projector. To decode these
            signals accurately, I constructed a specialized decoder unit to intercept the remote's transmissions and
            translate them into readable hex codes, with the device named [PROJ]- W0NG, named after the cover teacher we
            borrowed the remote from.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the decoder unit built and the hex codes successfully recorded, I moved on to the next phase of the
            project: building the remote control. Using Arduino chips, I programmed a new device to mimic the remote's
            signals. This device, which became the first working version of [PROJ] 3, was designed to send the same hex
            codes to the projector, effectively replicating the remote control's functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, I made multiple improvements and iterations to [PROJ]. Each new version saw enhancements in both
            functionality and aesthetics. I reduced the size of the device, making it more compact and portable, while
            also refining its appearance to be more sleek and professional. The functionality was also expanded,
            allowing for more complex and varied control over the projector. These improvements ensured that [PROJ]
            became not only a tool for creative disruptions but also a sophisticated piece of technology showcasing my
            growing technical skills and ingenuity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The creation of [PROJ] 3 was a significant milestone. It allowed me to control the projector remotely,
            opening up a range of possibilities for classroom pranks and creative disruptions. The ability to turn the
            projector on and off, change slides, or manipulate settings from a distance introduced a new level of
            engagement and mischief in an otherwise monotonous math class. The project not only satisfied my curiosity
            and technical interests but also brought a sense of excitement and novelty to my school experience.
