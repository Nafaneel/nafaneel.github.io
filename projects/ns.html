      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <h2 style="color: #dbd94d; text-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #999;">Overview</h2>
        <p>NexusSnarl was an ambitious project that evolved from a simple radio jamming concept into a sophisticated
          suite of tools designed to manipulate and control radio frequencies for various purposes. The project spanned
          multiple versions, incorporating improvements in both software and hardware to enhance functionality and
          reliability. The main objective was to experiment with radio technology, primarily focusing on disrupting
          communications in a school environment through custom-built radio equipment and software applications.</p>
        <h3>What Was NexusSnarl</h3>
        <p>NexusSnarl was a software-based system designed to interact with radio frequencies using a combination of
          hardware components and custom-developed applications. Its primary function was to transmit pre-recorded
          sounds and messages over specific radio frequencies, often for the purpose of disrupting or confusing
          communication systems within a designated area, such as a school. The system underwent several iterations,
          with each version introducing new features and improvements based on testing results and user feedback.</p>
        <h3>How It Worked</h3>
        <p>NexusSnarl functioned by integrating software applications with radio hardware to control and transmit
          signals. The system consisted of various components, each serving a specific role in the overall
          functionality. Here's a detailed look at the components and how they worked together:</p>
        <h2 style="color: #dbd94d; text-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #999;">Software</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>NexusSnarl</b><br>
            <p>NexusSnarl was the core software application responsible for controlling the radio transmissions. It
              managed the communication between the user's commands and the hardware components. Over its various
              versions, NexusSnarl incorporated features like token systems for controlling access, improved GUIs, and
              better integration with other software tools.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Switchr</b><br>
            <p>Switchr was a standalone bot designed to manage different programs within the NexusSnarl suite. It
              allowed users to control various aspects of the NexusSnarl system, such as starting or stopping Randomizer
              programs and executing specific commands remotely.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Randomizer</b><br>
            <p>The Randomizer application was responsible for playing random sounds from a specified folder at
              unpredictable intervals. It added an element of randomness to the transmissions, which could be used to
              disrupt communication systems more effectively.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Sequencr</b><br>
            <p>Sequencr was designed to play pre-defined sequences of sounds or messages. Unlike Randomizer, which
              focused on randomness, Sequencr allowed for more structured and deliberate transmission of audio content.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><b>TimeSpeakr</b><br>
            <p>TimeSpeakr was an application used to transmit time-based messages. It could schedule messages to be sent
              at specific times, allowing for more precise control over when certain sounds or messages were
              broadcasted.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Interface Terminal</b><br>
            <p>The Interface Terminal was a utility program that provided a command-line interface for interacting with
              the NexusSnarl system. It allowed users to input commands directly, manage settings, and monitor the
              status of the software and hardware components.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="color: #dbd94d; text-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #999;">Hardware</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Radio</b><br>
            <p>The radio was the primary hardware component used for transmitting signals. Various models were used
              throughout the project, including Baofeng radios and SDR (Software-Defined Radio) devices. The choice of
              radio affected the range, power, and quality of the transmissions.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>USB Interface</b><br>
            <p>The USB Interface was a critical component that connected the radio to a computer. It allowed for remote
              control of the radio's Push-to-Talk (PTT) function and facilitated communication between the NexusSnarl
              software and the hardware. With the introduction of NexusSnarl X, the USB Interface received a significant
              upgrade, incorporating DTMF (Dual-tone multi-frequency) encoding and decoding capabilities. This
              enhancement enabled more advanced remote control and VOIP (Voice Over IP) transmissions, providing greater
              flexibility and functionality.</p>
          </li>
          <li><b>Antenna</b><br>
            <p>The antenna was used to broadcast the radio signals over the air. Different types of antennas were
              experimented with, including whip antennas and MAG-Mount antennas. The effectiveness of the antenna was
              crucial for the range and clarity of the transmitted signals.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="color: #dbd94d; text-shadow: 0px 0px 10px #999;">The Story</h2>
        <h3>How It Started</h3>
        <p>The project began in January 2021...</p>
        <h3>First Test [16/07/22]</h3>
        <p>A significant milestone was achieved during a football injury recovery period. The first official test
          involved using an FT-4X radio to transmit test beeps, which were successfully received despite weak signal
          strength. This test marked the beginning of more sophisticated experiments, including recording and analyzing
          transmissions.</p>
        <h3>First Prototype [18/07/22]</h3>
        <p>The first prototype of NexusSnarl was developed during the Year 9 summer holidays. It utilized Discord.py API
          to communicate with Python applications and control the VOX (Voice Operated Exchange) feature of a Baofeng
          radio. This initial version laid the groundwork for more advanced iterations.</p>

              </div>
              <p>PMR JAMMER was the first successful version of the NexusSnarl system. It featured automated
                transmission using the VOX function and a whip antenna. Despite limited range and effectiveness, it
                marked the beginning of a more complex and refined system.</p>

              <p>NexusSnarl Version 1 was the first to feature a new name and branding to help eliminate and throw off
                any suspicions of the context of the bot compared to a name like “PMR JAMMER” which is a little more
                obvious. The version had only minor improvements from its previous version PMR Jammer, which includes a
                new name and retains most of the same GUI and features.
                <br><br>
                <b>RANDOMIZER</b><br>
                The software also included a new application I developed called “Randomizer” which sends random sounds
                within a selected folder through a radio at random times. The application had to be triggered through
                the bot with `~randomizer (INT)` with int meaning how many times to run. The software however wasn’t
                used as much and was just a relic within the program.

              </div>
              <p>
                After successful first tests of the first versions of NexusSnarl, the application was refined to the
                current setup with new features such as the Token system. The token system was introduced to limit the
                use of a bot and use a credit like system for the bot. Tokens are free but have to be administerd when I
                felt was right to not to upset the school too much. This was added as a result of over 110 activations
                in
                1 day, although many did not go through, I felt like it had to be limited in a way.
                <br><br>
                The token system proved to be a success and provided additional sucurity so that random users couldn’t
                activate the bot without permission. Visually the bot improved the formatting of the GUI and also
                messaged from the bot which improved the overall experience.
                The bot still used the same VOX setup and antenna system which had to be manually set up each day.
                <br><br>
                NexusSnarl 2 was eventually phased out and replaced with version 3 which had a good run of 5 Months

              </div>
              <p>NexusSnarl version 6 was the most groundbreaking version with a new look and infrastructure behind it.
                The main feature of this version was the integration of the USB PTT box which meant that the software
                had to be re-written in order to accommodate this feature. There was also upgrades to the UI of the
                messaging side of the bot which meant that reading and using functions were much easier.
                The software also came with a new package of other programs to assist with the bot these range from
                simple set up tools to handy testing programs</p>
